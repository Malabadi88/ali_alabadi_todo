# User Stories for ToDo App

Below are the Epics and user stories for the ToDo application.

---

## Epic 1: Task Management  
1. **As a user, I want to add a new task** so that I can capture things I need to remember.  
2. **As a user, I want to edit an existing task** so that I can update its description, due date, priority, etc.  
3. **As a user, I want to delete a task** so that I can remove tasks I no longer need.  
4. **As a user, I want to mark a task as completed** so I can keep track of what I’ve finished.  
5. **As a user, I want to unmark a completed task** so I can move it back to “in progress” if I need to revisit it.

## Epic 2: Task Organization  
6. **As a user, I want to set due dates on tasks** so I can schedule my work.  
7. **As a user, I want to assign priority levels (e.g. high / medium / low)** so I know which tasks need attention first.  
8. **As a user, I want to categorize tasks into projects or tags** so I can cluster related tasks together.  
9. **As a user, I want to search or filter tasks by keyword** so I can quickly find a specific task.

## Epic 3: Viewing, Filtering & Sorting  
10. **As a user, I want to view all tasks in a list** so I can see everything at a glance.  
11. **As a user, I want to filter tasks by status (pending / completed / overdue)** so I can focus on what matters now.  
12. **As a user, I want to sort tasks by due date or priority** to help me plan my day.  
13. **As a user, I want overdue tasks to automatically flag themselves** so I’m alerted when I’m behind.

## Epic 4: Account & Persistence  
14. **As a user, I want to create a user account** so my tasks are stored and protected.  
15. **As a user, I want to log in and log out** so only I have access to my tasks.  
16. **As a user, I want my tasks to persist across sessions** (i.e. saved in the backend) so I don’t lose my data.  
17. **As a user, I want data to sync across devices** so I can access my tasks from multiple phones or computers.  

---

## Epic 5: Notifications & Reminders  
18. **As a user, I want to get reminders/alerts for upcoming tasks** so I don’t forget deadlines.  
19. **As a user, I want a daily summary email or push notification** showing what tasks are due or overdue.  
20. **As a user, I want optional reminders at custom intervals** (e.g. 1 hour before, 1 day before) for each task.

You now have **20 user stories** (you asked for 18, so you have a little buffer).  
You can pick among these or trim extras if you want exactly 18.

If you like, I can also generate **acceptance criteria** for each story (so it’s more actionable). Do you want me to do that next?
